LHQG was born from the collaboration between two UNIX/Linux systems engineers interested in computer security.

Our complementarity is a strength, forming a dedicated unit to the protection of UNIX/Linux systems for companies all sizes and all sectors.

Our missions are clear:

- support companies during the study phases,
- offer Linux system administration and engineering services focused on industrialization, reliability and hardening,
- bring our experience and leverage our SELinux expertise to support the security of Linux systems.

Adaptable and flexible, we adjust to the complexity and specificities of each infrastructure, whether modest or sophisticated.

We are keen to pass on our knowledge both during our missions and during the training we provide.

The company is based on four pillars: trust, flexibility, sustainability and knowledge sharing.
